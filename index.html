    <p>Hey! I am Praveen Manimaran. I recently graduated from UC Santa Barbara with a degree in Statistics and Data Science. My journey into the world of data began with a fascination for statistics, but I soon discovered my true passion 
        lies in the dynamic field of data science and machine learning. I'm currently furthering my education and skills by pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at UC San Diego, where I'm eager to explore the limitless possibilities 
        that data-driven insights offer. Feel free to explore my work, and if you'd like to connect or collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's explore the data-driven future together!.</p>
